# DTDWT

Dual-tree discrete wavelet transform (DTDWT) is another variant of Discrete wavelet transform that is nearly shift invariant but with much less redundancy.

The Aim of this study is to understand in many domains, complex systems will generate data that is naturally arranged in large matrices, or more generally in arrays.

The Algorithm that used in this study can be divide into 

1. Explore the datasets
2. Normalize the data using zero means
3. Transform data into wavelet domain using DTDWT technique with level 4 tree
4. Determine the frequency of data interest and noise 
5. Threshold the data using Hard thresholding and soft thresholding
6. Inverse DTDWT
7. Calculate MSE and RMSE
8. Visualize the data before and after denoising
